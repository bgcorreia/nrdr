Overview: The ncRNA-Protein Interaction Database (NPInter) is a repository of experimentally verified functional interactions between ncRNAs (excluding tRNAs and rRNAs) and protein related biomacromolecules (proteins, mRNAs or genomic DNAs). The authors use a classification system of ncRNA functional interactions, which are divided into eight different interaction processes: i) ncRNA binds to protein, ii) ncRNA regulates the mRNA, iii) ncRNA indirectly regulates a gene (DNA), iv) ncRNA is regulated by the protein, v) ncRNA as a factor affects the protein's function, vi) The protein as a factor affects the ncRNA's function, vii) genetic interaction between the ncRNA gene and the protein gene, viii) special linkages between the ncRNA and the protein.
