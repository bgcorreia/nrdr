Database Name: NPInter
RNA Type: Multiple classes
Overview: The ncRNA-Protein Interaction Database (NPInter) is a repository of experimentally verified functional interactions between ncRNAs (excluding tRNAs and rRNAs) and protein related biomacromolecules (proteins, mRNAs or genomic DNAs). The authors use a classification system of ncRNA functional interactions, which are divided into eight different interaction processes: i) ncRNA binds to protein, ii) ncRNA regulates the mRNA, iii) ncRNA indirectly regulates a gene (DNA), iv) ncRNA is regulated by the protein, v) ncRNA as a factor affects the protein's function, vi) The protein as a factor affects the ncRNA's function, vii) genetic interaction between the ncRNA gene and the protein gene, viii) special linkages between the ncRNA and the protein.

Database Name: Pharmaco-miR
RNA Type: miRNA
Overview: A major discovery is the ability of miRNAs to determine the efficacy of drugs, which has given rise to the field of â€˜miRNA pharmacogenomicsâ€™ through â€˜Pharmaco-miRsâ€™. miRNAs play a significant role in pharmacogenomics by down-regulating genes that are important for drug function. These interactions can be described as triplet sets consisting of a miRNA, a target gene and a drug associated with the gene. We have developed a web server which links miRNA expression and drug function by combining data on miRNA targeting and protein^ drug interactions. miRNA targeting information derive from both experimental data and computational predictions, and protein^ drug interactions are annotated by the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge base (PharmGKB). Pharmaco-miRâ€™s input consists of miRNAs, genes and/or drug names and the output consists of miRNA pharmacogenomic sets or a list of unique associated miRNAs, genes and drugs.We have furthermore built a database, named Pharmaco-miR Verified Sets (VerSe), which contains miRNA pharmacogenomic data manually
curated from the literature, can be searched and downloaded via Pharmaco-miR and informs on trends and generalities
published in the field. Overall, we present examples of how Pharmaco-miR provides possible explanations for previously published observations, including how the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil resistance induced by miR-148a may be caused by miR-148a targeting of the gene KIT
